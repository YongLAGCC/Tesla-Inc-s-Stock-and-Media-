## Thesis/Hypothesis
- We believe that the attitude in major media outlets such as Twitter and Wall Street Journal may have a strong influence (such as correlation) on the Tesla’s stock price right after the news release. It has long been hypothesized that the stock price are particularly susceptible to breaking news on social media. For instance, when Elon Musk (Tesla’s CEO) himself gives out the unplanned news, it seems like the market would experience extreme momentary fluctuations. The purpose of the project is to collect information from social media and news platforms and analysis their influence on the Tesla’s stock price. We believe that if our research finds a correlation between stock movements and news, then we might be able to create trading strategies. Otherwise, the absence of correlation should teach us not to trade stocks purely based on breaking news.
